# Current Version: Pre-Alpha-1.0.0

# Description
Little [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) API I'm working on in python using [Pygame Community Edition](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce).  The goal of this API is to be a tool that allows you to quickly make little Cellular Automata minigames very quickly in python.  Right now it is just a proof of concept.  To run, run the main.py script.  Currently just displays a small simulation that you can control using the arrow keys.  You can change some basic values in the data.json file.
# Current Project Goals
- Clean up the code to make a release that actually functions as an API
- Make more JSON based variables
	- to make games more easily configurable for the average user
# Notes
- Will be releasing the first Alpha build when a usable API is setup
